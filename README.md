# COREDUMP (COmputational REtrieval of DUst Model Parameters)

Welcome to the *COREDUMP* repository. The code inside this repository can be used to automatically derive the properties of circumstellar dust using

1. a measured astronomical infrared (IR) spectrum of the dust,
2. a library of laboratory data with the optical properties of different dust species,
3. a radiative transfer code of choice, and
4. an optimization algorithm of choice.
